# üñ•Ô∏è PC_rename

The goal of this script is to automate the process of changing the computer names within the enterprise or domain directly from the Active Directory (AD). I have created an English version as well as a French version of the script, and I am currently working on a Russian version. If you have any questions or specific requests, please feel free to ask!  üëç
